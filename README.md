# generator-typescript-ocd

## NOTE

This is very much a WIP. Check back soon!

## Install

This will change once the package gets published to the npm registry,
so for now you will need to clone the repository and `npm link`.

```
git clone https://github.com/tzellman/generator-typescript-ocd.git
cd generator-typescript-ocd
npm i
npm run build
npm link
```

## Usage

This will also change as the generator becomes more robust.

It is assumed that you have `yeoman` installed already (likely globally).

If not, then run `npm i -g yo`.

Next, cd to a new or existing directory and run...

```
yo typescript-ocd
```

... and follow the prompts.
